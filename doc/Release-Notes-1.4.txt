========================================================================

    C version of ftpget
    -------------------

	The 'ftpget' program has been rewritten in C.  The Perl version
	caused core-dumps for a number of users.  The C version is
	more reliable and efficient.

    HUP signal rotates log files
    ----------------------------

	Sending the cached process a HUP signal "rotates" the log
	files.  Each active log file is closed and then renamed with a
	digit extension.  The configuration parameter rotate_number
	specifies how many rotated log files to keep.  If set to zero,
	the log files are simply closed and re-opened, allowing them to
	be renamed manually.

    Querying neighbors based on URL domains
    ---------------------------------------

	By default the cache queries all neighbors (and parents) for
	requested objects which it does not already have.  It is now
	possible to selectively query neighbors based on the domain name
	of the requested URL.  This is done with the 'cache_host_domain'
	directive in the configuration file.  The usage is:

		cache_host_domain  neighbor-name  domain [domain...]
		cache_host_domain  neighbor-name  !domain [domain...]

	The 'neighbor-name' must match the host name of a neighbor
	previously specified with a 'cache_host' line.  The same
	'neighbor-name' may appear on multiple 'cache_host_domain'
	lines.

	It is possible to specify that a neighbor should be queried only
	when the domain matches, or when it does not match (by
	prepending a !  to the domain).

	The order of listed domains is important.  The action of the
	first domain to match is taken.  ("action" means "do query" for
	'domain' and "do not query" for '!domain').  If the URL does not
	match any listed domains, the default action is the opposite of
	the last one.

	For example, assume your cache was running inside an
	organization named "this.org."  Requests for URLs inside the
	domain should be forwarded to other caches inside the this.org,
	but not up to the parent cache running outside of this.org.
	Similarly, for URLs outside of this.org there is no need to
	query the inside neighbors.  The configuration would look like:

		cache_host neighbor N1.this.org 3128 3130
		cache_host neighbor N2.this.org 3128 3130
		cache_host parent   P1.foo.net  3128 3130

		cache_host_domain   N1.this.org	    this.org
		cache_host_domain   N2.this.org	    this.org
		cache_host_domain   P1.foo.net	    !this.org

    Dealing with file descriptor shortages
    -------------------------------------

	An extremely busy cache may occasionally run out of file
	descriptors.  This is especially a problem on SunOS where each
	process is limited to 256 FDs.  Additionally some Unix kernels
	seem to be slow in recycling socket FDs even though they
	received a proper close().  For that reason the cache process
	and the kernel have different values for the number of available
	FDs.

	Running out of FDs causes real problems for active objects (e.g.
	swapping the object to disk will fail).  For this reason we now
	start denying new client connections when the cache calculates
	that only 64 FDs are available.  For each socket(), accept(), and 
	open() failures then the number of reserved FDs is increased by
        1, to a limit of MAXFD-64.

    Multiple swap directories
    -------------------------

	The cache now supports having multiple 'cache_dir' directories.
	The cache objects will be saved in each directory in round-robin
	fashion.  For example, if the configuration file contained

		cache_dir    /bigdisk1/cache
		cache_dir    /bigdisk2/cache

	Then the first four objects would be saved as

		/bigdisk1/cache/01/1
		/bigdisk2/cache/01/2
		/bigdisk1/cache/02/3
		/bigdisk2/cache/02/4

	The parameter cache_swap specifies the total, maximum disk space
	to use for swap files, not the amount to use for each swap
	directory.

    Separate IP ACLs for proxy and httpd-accel
    ------------------------------------------

	When 'httpd_accel_with_proxy on' is in the config file, the cached
	process can handle both proxy and httpd-accel requests at the
	same time.  However, there was only a single IP address
	access list to control client access to both types of requests.

	It is now possible to have separate IP ACLs for proxy and
	httpd-accel requests.  The configuration file supports
	six directives for specifying IP ACLs:

		proxy_allow
		proxy_deny
		accel_allow
		accel_deny
		manager_allow
		manager_deny

	If no address are given for the accel ACL then it defaults to
	be the same as the proxy ACL.

    Command line option (-D) to disable DNS tests
    ---------------------------------------------

	Upon startup the cache queries a handful of well known Internet
	host names to ensure that the host name resolver (i.e.  DNS) is
	working properly.  This may be undesirable for sites behind
	firewalls or those with very slow links to the greater Internet.
	It is now possible to disable these DNS tests with a -D option
	on the cached command line.


    Periodic garbage collection disabled by default
    -----------------------------------------------

	The parameter 'clean_rate' determines how often the cache should
	perform a full garbage collection.  This involves removing all
	expired objects and reclaiming disk space.

	For very large caches it will take a significant amount of time
	to garbage collect on every object.  During this time processing
	of cache requests from users is suspended.  For this
	reason, full garbage collection is now disabled by default.

	The preferred method of garbage collection is to check only a
	small number of objects approximately every second.  If you have
	used previous versions of the cache, Please check your cache
	configuration file and make sure the clean_rate parameter is
	really what you want.



    Firewalls
    ---------

	A number of changes have been made so that cached works 
	better behind a firewall.  If you want to run cached
	behind (i.e. "inside", but not *on*) a firewall then you
	should use these configuration parameters:

	cache_host:		This should point to your proxy server
				running on the firewall host.

	inside_firewall:	A list of domains which are inside your
				firewall.  If a URL-host does not match
				one of these domains, the request will
				be forwarded to a parent cache.

	local_domain:		A list of domains which the cache can
				connect directly to.  If a URL-host
				matches one of these domains, we never
				query the parents or neighbors.

	single_parent_bypass:	If you have only one parent cache (and
				no neighbor caches), then it may make
				sense for you to set this to 'yes'.
				When behind a firewall, and there is
				only one parent, it makes little sense
				to query the parent, wait for the reply,
				and then fetch the object from the
				parent regardless whether the reply is
				HIT or MISS.


    Description of server selection algorithm
    -----------------------------------------

	When cached recieves a request for an object not already in
	its cache, it must decide where the object should be fetched
	from.  In general, an object might be fetched from a cache
	neighbor, cache parent, or the source site (URL-host).

	Below is a flow chart of sorts, which describes how cached
	will choose the site to fetch the object from.

        Is the URL-host beyond our firewall?
                |             |
                No           Yes->  Query the hierarchy,
                |                   No DNS lookup for URL-host.
                |
        Is the object uncachable, or
        is URL-host one of the local domains?
                |             |
                No           Yes->  Fetch the object directly
                |                   from the URL-host.
                |
        Is there a local_ip list?
                |             |
                No           Yes->  Do a DNS lookup for URL-host
                |                   so we can check it in the list.
                |
        Would we Query any parents/neighbors for this URL?
        (i.e., check the cache_host_domain restrictions).
                |             | 
                Yes           No->  Fetch directly from URL-host
                |
        Would we ping only a single parent,
        and not also ping the source host,
        and is single_parent_bypass on?
                |             |
                No            Yes->  Fetch directly from the
                |                    single parent cache.
                |
                +----------------->  Query the hierarchy, do a 
                                     DNS lookup for URL-host.


    Description of neighbor resolution algorithm
    --------------------------------------------

	* Query all neighbors and parents, subject to cache_host_domain
	  configuration.
	* Query the source site if 'source_ping on' and the URL-host is
	  not beyond a firewall.
	* If the object is uncachable (e.g. cgi-bin scripts), do not
	  query the neighbors and parents.  Instead just request it
	  from the first allowable parent.

	The cache will begin fetching the object as soon as one of the
	following occurs:

	* a HIT message is received.
	* all query replies (i.e. MISSes) arrive.
	* the 'neighbor_timeout' timeout occurs (default
	  two seconds).

	At this point, the object will be retrieved from one of the
	following, in order:

        * The first neighbor or parent to reply with a HIT message.
          NOTE: the source host always returns a HIT if queried.
        * The first parent to reply with a MISS message.
        * The source server if it is not beyond a firewall.
        * The single-parent for the URL-host, if appropriate.
        * If none of the above apply, an error message is generated.


    The CGI cache manager interface
    -------------------------------

	Versions prior to v1.4 included a tcl/tk cache manager program.
	That program has been dropped from the distribution due to its
	difficulty to install and maintain.  We now provide a CGI
	program which can be used to monitor the cache process.

	This program is installed as $prefix/cgi-bin/cachemgr.cgi.  To
	enable it from your httpd server, you should either copy the
	executable to your httpd's cgi-bin directory, make a symbolic
	link, or configure your http to enable running CGI scripts from
	$prefix/cgi-bin.  Don't forget to ensure that the httpd process
	has permission to execute the file.

	Note that security is essentially defeated with the cachemgr.cgi
	program.  The configuration parameters manager_allow and
	manager_deny specify which IP addresses may make cache manager
	reqeusts.  With the CGI program, the requests will be coming
	from the httpd server host.  So anyone with access to the CGI
	program will also have access to the cache manager functions.
	Most of these functions are harmless and provide only very
	general information.  Very paranoid administrators may wish to
	totally disable cache manager access to their cache.

	In order to shut down the cache from the CGI program a password
	must be provided.  The password is taken from the /etc/passwd
	file for the user 'cache'.  If there is no user 'cache' in the
	system password file, then the cache cannot be shut down from
	the cachemgr.cgi program.

	Note that the "shutdown" command causes the current cache
	process to exit.  If the RunCache script is running, another
	cache process will be automatically restarted.


    Virtual host support
    --------------------

	The cache supports a simple form a virtual host operation
	for the httpd-accelerator mode.  When the -V command line
	option is given, incoming requests are rewritten with the
	IP address of the local socket.  For example, the request

		/index.html

	might be rewritten as

		http://172.16.0.1/index.html

	If -V is given, then the 'http_accel'configuration parameters 
	are ignored.


    Fast restart mode
    ----------------

	The cache now supports a fast restart mode.  The ability to
	perform a fast reload depends on the swap log file being
	"clean" when the cache last exited.  A clean log file gets
	written when:
		- the cached process is killed with a SIGTERM
		  or SIGINT signal.
		- the process exits due to a "Segmentation Violation"
		  or "Bus Error" and the -C command line option
		  was not given.

	A fast restart means that the cache does not call stat(2)
	for each swap file on disk.  It assumes that the swap files
	have not been removed or modified since the swap log was
	last written.

	The first time you start the v1.4 cache, it will not be possible
	to do a fast restart (but the disk files will be preserved).
	This is because the swap log file now includes the object size
	as a fifth field for each object.


    Dealing with cache stalls under SunOS 4.1.x
    -------------------------------------------

	SunOS has a 5 connection listen limit which is insufficient
	under high workload.  You can patch your kernel to increase this
	to a reasonable number.  Instructions are outlined in
	http://excalibur.usc.edu/cachedoc/sunos.txt


    New UDP-based cache announcement service
    ----------------------------------------

	In version 1.3, the cache would send an email message to
	cache_tracker@cs.colorado.edu to announce itself.  The email
	code has been removed for a couple of reasons.  To take its
	place, we provide an external, UDP-based announcement program
	('send-announcement').

	The announcement is disabled by default.  To enable it, change
	the value of 'cache_announce' in your configuration file.

	This service is provided to help Harvest cache administrators
	locate one another in order to join or create cache hierarchies.
	For more information see the Web page at
	http://www.nlanr.net/Cache/Tracker/


    Other additions to cache configuration file
    -------------------------------------------

	* ascii_port
        * udp_port 

	  The "Ascii" and "UDP" ports can now be specified in the
	  configuration file with 'ascii_port' and 'udp_port'.  Values
	  given with -a and -u command line options will override those
	  in the configuration file.

	* proxy-only

	  This has been added as an option to the 'cache_host'
	  instruction.  Previously, we used 'neighbor_cache_obj' to
	  enable or disable the local caching of objects fetched from
	  all neighbors.  With 'proxy-only' it is possible to disable
	  local caching of objects fetched for specific neighbors or
	  parents.

	* connect_timeout

	  Some systems (notably Linux) can not be relied upon to
	  properly time out connect(2) requests.  This parameter can be
	  used to force pending connections to close before the
	  operating system timeout occurs.

	* neighbor_timeout

	  Previously this timeout was hardcoded as two seconds.  It is
	  how long to wait for ICP replies to arrive before we start
	  fetching an object from the source.


    Cached-1.5 Pre-Announcement
    ---------------------------

	The next version of the cache will support

		1) GET If-Modified-Since requests hierarchically, and
		   intelligently use neighbors and parents.
		2) A multiplexing mode for getting around
		   file-descriptor limits
		3) Better logging
		4) Dynamic neighbor and parent installation
		5) Decreased meta-data size
		6) Storage manager extended to handle big objects 
		7) Redirection and stop lists
		8) Double peak-load performance
