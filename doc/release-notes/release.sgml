<sect>Key changes from squid 2.6

<p>This section describes the main news since the 2.6 release
<p>
  <itemize>
    <item>
        Experimental support for HTTP/1.1, mainly targeted at reverse proxy
	installations. Not yet HTTP/1.1 compliant hoewever.
    </item>
    <item>
        A number of performance improvements; including request/reply parser,
	eliminating various redundant data copies and some completely rewritten
	sections.
    </item>
    <item>
        Support for WAIS has been removed.
    </item>
    <item>
        "act-as-origin" option for http_port - Squid can now emulate an origin
	server when acting as an accelerator.
    </item>
    <item>
        "min-size" option for cache_dir - the minimum object size to store in
	a cache directory. Previously objects of any size up to a "max-size"
	maximum size would be considered as candidated for storing in a store_dir;
	this option allows the administrator to tune various stores for small
	and large objects rather than trying to tune it for both.
    </item>
    <item>
        Support for Solaris /dev/poll for network IO - more efficient than
	poll() or select() and backwards compatible to Solaris 7. This must
	be manually enabled during configure by specifying "--enable-devpoll".
    </item>
    <item>
        Support for FreeBSD accept filters. Use "accept_filter httpready"
	in squid.conf to enable this.
    </item>
    <item>
        A semi-modular logging framework has been introduced, which both
	allows for more efficient non-blocking logging with the supplied logging
	daemon, but also allows for third-party modules to intercept the squid
	logs and process them. An example "UDP" logging helper, thanks to the
	Wikimedia Foundation, is included.
    </item>
    <item>
        Support for rewriting URLs into canonical forms when storing and retrieving
	objects. A common practice seen in Content Delivery Networks is to serve
	the same content from a variety of different URLs or hosts; this makes
	efficient caching difficult. The store URL rewriting framework allows the
	administrator to rewrite a variety of URLs into one canonical form, so
	matching content from a variety of sources can be stored and retrieved
	as if they came from the same source, whilst still fetching the content
	from the original destination.

	See the "storeurl_rewrite_program" option for more information, and
	http://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/StoreURLRewrite for some examples.
    </item>
    <item>
        Object revalidation can now occur in the background. Cache validation can
	now occur in the background without requiring an active client to drive it.
	Stale content being revalidated can be served in situ whilst the object
	is being refreshed. See the "max_stale" and "refresh_pattern" options for more
	information.
    </item>
    <item>
        introduce a new option, "zero_buffers", which controls whether Squid will
	zero the memory used for buffers and other data structures before use.
	This may or may not improve performance on specific workloads.
    </item>
    <item>
        Cache authentication based on source IP address. This reduces the pressure
	on external authenticators which may not be able to keep up under high load -
	NTLM/winbind is a good example of this. See the "authenticate_ip_shortcircuit_access"
	and "authenticate_ip_shortcircuit_ttl" options for more information.
    </item>
    <item>
        Support for configuration file includes has been added. "include" can now be
	used to include a configuration file or a glob of configuration files in a
	directory.
    </item>
    <item>
        The default rules to not cache dynamic content from cgi-bin and query URLs
	have been altered. Previously, the "cache" ACL was used to mark requests
	as non-cachable - this is enforced even on dynamic content which returns
	cachability information. This has changed in Squid-2.7 to use the default
	refresh pattern. Dynamic content is now cached if it is marked as cachable.
	You should remove the default configuration lines with QUERY (acl, and cache)
	and replace them with the correct refresh_pattern entries.
    </item>
    <item>
	Accelerator mode support cleaned up to behave more consistent when
	combining multiple accelerator mode options
    </item>
    <item>
	Zero Penalty Hit support, allowing cache misses to be marked by custom
	TOS/priority values, useful when using packet shaping/prioritization
	outside Squid and needing to separate cache hits from misses.
    </item>
</itemize>

</itemize>

<sect>Windows support

<p>This Squid version can run on Windows as a system service using the Cygwin emulation environment, 
or can be compiled in Windows native mode using the MinGW + MSYS development environment. Windows NT 4 SP4 and later are supported.

On Windows 2000 and later the service is configured to use the Windows Service Recovery option
restarting automatically after 60 seconds.

<sect1>Usage

<p>Some new command line options was added for the Windows service support:

The service installation is made with -i command line switch, it's possible to use -f switch at
the same time for specify a different config-file settings for the Squid Service that will be
stored on the Windows Registry.

A new -n switch specify the Windows Service Name, so multiple Squid instance are allowed.
<em/"Squid"/ is the default when the switch is not used.

So, to install the service, the syntax is: 

<p><verb>squid -i [-f file] [-n name]</verb>

Service uninstallation is made with -r command line switch with the appropriate -n switch.

The -k switch family must be used with the appropriate -f and -n switches, so the syntax is: 

<verb>squid -k command [-f file] -n service-name</verb>
where <em/service-name/ is the name specified with -n options at service install time.

To use the Squid original command line, the new -O switch must be used ONCE, the syntax is: 

<verb>squid -O cmdline [-n service-name]</verb>
If multiple service command line options must be specified, use quote. The -n switch is
needed only when a non default service name is in use.

Don't use the "Start parameters" in the Windows 2000/XP/2003 Service applet: they are
specific to Windows services functionality and Squid is not designed for understand they.

In the following example the command line of the "squidsvc" Squid service is set to "-D -u 3130": 

<verb>squid -O "-D -u 3130" -n squidsvc</verb>

<sect1>PSAPI.DLL (Process Status Helper) Considerations

<p>The process status helper functions make it easier for you to obtain information about
processes and device drivers running on Microsoft® Windows NT®/Windows® 2000. These
functions are available in PSAPI.DLL, which is distributed in the Microsoft® Platform
Software Development Kit (SDK). The same information is generally available through the
performance data in the registry, but it is more difficult to get to it. PSAPI.DLL is
freely redistributable.

PSAPI.DLL is available only on Windows NT, 2000, XP and 2003. The implementation in Squid is
aware of this, and try to use it only on the right platform.

On Windows NT PSAPI.DLL can be found as component of many applications, if you need it,
you can find it on Windows NT Resource KIT. If you have problem, it can be
downloaded from here:
<url url="http://download.microsoft.com/download/platformsdk/Redist/4.0.1371.1/NT4/EN-US/psinst.EXE" name="http://download.microsoft.com/download/platformsdk/Redist/4.0.1371.1/NT4/EN-US/psinst.EXE">

On Windows 2000 and later it is available installing the Windows Support Tools, located on the
Support\Tools folder of the installation Windows CD-ROM.

<sect1>Registry DNS lookup

<p>On Windows platforms, if no value is specified in the <em/dns_nameservers/ option on
squid.conf or in the /etc/resolv.conf file, the list of DNS name servers are
taken from the Windows registry, both static and dynamic DHCP configurations
are supported.

<sect1>Compatibility Notes
<p><itemize>
<item>It's recommended to use '/' char in Squid paths instead of '\'
<item>Paths with spaces (like 'C:\Programs Files\Squid) are NOT supported by Squid
<item>When using ACL like 'acl aclname acltype "file"' the file must be in DOS text
format (CR+LF) and the full Windows path must be specified, for example:

<verb>acl blocklist url_regex -i "c:/squid/etc/blocked1.txt"</verb>

<item>The Windows equivalent of '/dev/null' is 'NUL'
<item>Squid doesn't know how to run external helpers based on scripts, like .bat, .cmd,
.vbs, .pl, etc. So in squid.conf the interpreter path must be always specified, for example:

<verb>redirect_program c:/perl/bin/perl.exe c:/squid/libexec/redir.pl
redirect_program c:/winnt/system32/cmd.exe /C c:/squid/libexec/redir.cmd</verb>
<item>When Squid runs in command line mode, the launching user account must have administrative privilege on the system
<item>"Start parameters" in the Windows 2000/XP/2003 Service applet cannot be used
<item>Building with MinGW, when the configure option --enable-truncate is used, Squid cannot run on Windows NT, only Windows 2000 and later are supported
</itemize>

<sect1>Known Limitations:

<p><itemize>
<item>DISKD: still needs to be ported
<item>WCCP: cannot work because user space GRE support on Windows is missing
<item>Transparent Proxy: missing Windows non commercial interception driver
<item>Some code sections can make blocking calls.
<item>Some external helpers may not work.
<item>File Descriptors number hard-limited to 2048 when building with MinGW.
</itemize>

<sect1>Using cache manager on Windows:

<p>On Windows, cache manager (cachemgr.cgi) can be used with Microsoft IIS or Apache.
Some specific configuration could be needed:

<sect2>IIS 6 (Windows 2003)
<p>On IIS 6.0 all CGI extensions are denied by default for security reason, so the following configuration is needed:
<p><itemize>
<item>Create a cgi-bin Directory
<item>Define the cgi-bin IIS Virtual Directory with read and CGI execute IIS
permissions, ASP scripts are not needed. This automatically defines a
cgi-bin IIS web application 
<item>Copy cachemgr.cgi into cgi-bin directory and look to file permissions:
the IIS system account and SYSTEM must be able to read and execute the file
<item>In IIS manager go to Web Service extensions and add a new Web Service
Extension called <em/"Squid Cachemgr"/, add the cachemgr.cgi file and set the
extension status to <em/Allowed/
</itemize>

<sect2>Apache:
<p>On Windows, cachemgr.cgi needs to create a temporary file, so Apache must be instructed
 to pass the TMP and TEMP Windows environment variables to CGI applications:
<verb>
ScriptAlias /squid/cgi-bin/ "c:/squid/libexec/"
&lt;Location /squid/cgi-bin/cachemgr.cgi&gt;
    PassEnv TMP TEMP
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from workstation.example.com
&lt;/Location&gt;
</verb>
